# mc_espace

`mc_espace` is a set of model checking tools implemented on the
[espace](https://github.com/fredyouhanaie/espace) platform.

`espace` is an implementation of
[tuple spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_space) in
Erlang. The platform enables creation of concurrent processes that
communicate and coordinate through a central tuple store.

Initially the tools will cover petri nets and basic structural
analysis, as well as state space exploration.
